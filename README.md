#Truncating in php

Here is a function , you should pass a paragraph to it  and it would return a truncate text with your maximum charector .

```
function truncate($text, $chars = 25)

```

For the instance you create a variable called $post and you set the Truncate function to it with the maximum char and this is really easy .
